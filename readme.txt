This plugin stores tokens from apps used for push notifications. It creates an api endpoint which your app can send tokens to and also supports a key to make the url unique.

== Description ==

This plugin stores tokens from apps used for push notifications. It creates an api endpoint which your app can send tokens to and also supports a key to make the url unique.

In the future I want to update this to support export functions, sending of push notifications and more.

Currently the app stores all UDIDs in the prefix_anveto_pushnotification table in your wordpress database.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `anveto-pushnotifications` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
